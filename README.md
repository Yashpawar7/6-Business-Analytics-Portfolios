# 6 Business-Analytics-Portfolios
## Mastering Time Series Decomposition, ARIMA, ANN, Logistic Regression, Clustering & Conjoint Analysis

## 1. Time Series Decomposition & Forecasting: Applied moving averages and seasonal decomposition to 1949-1959 US airline passenger data in Excel, calculated seasonal indices, and generated 1960 forecasts with MAE/MSE validation.
## 2. ARIMA Modeling in SPSS: Selected and estimated an optimal ARIMA(p,d,q) model for UK COVID-19 daily cases, confirmed stationarity via ACF/PACF diagnostics, and produced seven-day ahead forecasts.
## 3. ANN Forecasting: Designed, trained, and validated an artificial neural network in SPSS to predict the GBP/USD exchange rate, with inputs selected through autocorrelation and performance metrics demonstrating strong one-step-ahead accuracy.
## 4. Logistic Regression Analysis: Built a logistic regression classifier on Fresco Supermarket loyalty data to distinguish low vs. high spenders, interpreted model coefficients for actionable marketing insights, and achieved robust predictive performance.
## 5. Customer Segmentation (Clustering): Conducted k-means and hierarchical clustering on UK bank customer profiles, refining feature selection and data preprocessing to identify homogenous segments for targeted product development.
## 6. Conjoint Analysis Study: Designed a full-factorial conjoint survey on six smartphone attributes, collected preference rankings, and used linear regression to compute utility scores, highlighting the features with the greatest impact on consumer choice.
